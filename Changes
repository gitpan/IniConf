This module was originally written by Scott Hutton. If you know how
to get hold of Scott, please let me know.
I wanted a few small additional features, but was never able
to track down Scott to submit patches, so I'm just rereleasing this
myself. I suppose at some point, I'll need to actually read through
all the code and try to figure out if anything else in here needs
updating, but at the moment, I just needed to new functionality.

So, the changes:
1) Modified ReadConfig to permit spaces in the variable names
2) Added newval method to add new values to the ini file
3) Added delval method to delete values from the ini file
