This module was originally written by Scott Hutton. If you know how
to get hold of Scott, please let me know.
I wanted a few small additional features, but was never able
to track down Scott to submit patches, so I'm just rereleasing this
myself. I suppose at some point, I'll need to actually read through
all the code and try to figure out if anything else in here needs
updating, but at the moment, I just needed to new functionality.

So, the changes:
1) Modified ReadConfig to permit spaces in the variable names
2) Added newval method to add new values to the ini file
3) Added delval method to delete values from the ini file

Previous Version History:
#
# Version 0.92 1997/07/11
# BUGFIX: Perl 5.004 complained about an extraneous "my" in ReadConfig()
# BUGFIX: value of 0 or empty string would trigger a fallthrough to the
#         default value.  Check to see if this is defined now (in val()).
# Version 0.91 1996/08/09
# ADDED: support for multivalued/multiline fields.
# ADDED: @IniConf::errors for diagnosing bad config file.
# BUGFIX: added "require 5.002".  5.001 doesn't handle "use strict", and
#         I live by it.
# BUGFIX: OutputConfig.  Would complain about a bad ref when no comments
#         are specified for a section or parameter.
